### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

The following provides a quick overview of the main components and their interactions.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* provides its functionality through a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class that implements the corresponding API interface.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in `Logic.java` and implements it in `LogicManager.java`. Other components interact with a component through its interface rather than its concrete class, preventing them from coupling to that component's implementation, as illustrated in the following partial class diagram.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` and its parts, such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, and `StatusBarFooter`. All of these, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures common behavior among classes that represent visible GUI parts.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files in `src/main/resources/view`. For example, [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml) specifies the layout of [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component because it displays `Person` objects from the model.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, it continues to the end of the diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, the command is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object, which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above for simplicity, the code can require several interactions between the command object and the `Model` to complete the operation.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name, e.g., `AddCommandParser`). The parser uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`). The `AddressBookParser` returns that object as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes, such as `AddCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandParser`, implement the `Parser` interface so they can be treated similarly where appropriate, for example during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data: `Person` objects in a `UniquePersonList` and `Pet` objects in a `UniquePetList`.
* represents each `Pet` using a name, owner, species, optional breed, and grooming requirement. A pet holds a reference to its owning `Person`; when a person is replaced, any pets owned by that person are updated to reference the replacement person.
* stores the `Person` and `Pet` objects selected by their current filters in separate _filtered_ lists. It exposes these as unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Pet>` instances that the UI can observe and bind to, so the UI updates when the lists change.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences (currently, just the GUI settings). This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The alternative, arguably more object-oriented, design below keeps a unique list of tags in `AddressBook`, and each `Person` references tags from that list. This lets `AddressBook` maintain one `Tag` object per unique tag instead of each `Person` holding its own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* saves address book data, appointments, and user preferences in separate JSON files and reads them back into objects.
* is implemented by `StorageManager`, which delegates file access to `JsonAddressBookStorage`, `JsonAppointmentBookStorage`, and `JsonUserPrefsStorage`.
* serializes people using `JsonAdaptedPerson` and pets using `JsonAdaptedPet`. A saved pet records its owner's name and phone, plus an optional breed. Loading resolves the owner by phone when available, or by name for older records.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

#### Appointment persistence

Persistence keeps appointments after the application closes. `AppointmentBook` holds the working schedule in memory;
`data/appointments.json` holds the saved schedule on disk. Appointment storage classes live in `storage/appointment/`:

* `AppointmentStorage` defines the read, save, and file-path operations.
* `JsonAdaptedAppointment` converts one appointment's phone, pet name, date, times, and service into JSON fields and back.
* `JsonSerializableAppointmentBook` converts the complete list and rejects invalid or overlapping records on loading.
* `JsonAppointmentBookStorage` reads and writes the file. It finishes writing a temporary file before replacing the
  saved file, using an atomic move where the filesystem supports it.

The flow is `ScheduleCommand` → `AppointmentBook` → `StorageManager` → `data/appointments.json`.
`LogicManager` reports success only after saving. If saving fails, it restores the previous in-memory schedule and
reports the error, so the user can retry. Contact commands continue to save only the contact file; `clear` retains
appointments.

At startup, `MainApp` loads the appointment file and passes the result to `Model.setAppointmentBook`.
Loading allows historical appointments and does not depend on current owner/pet lookup. If the file is absent, the
schedule starts empty. Invalid files produce a log warning and an empty schedule without modifying the file.
Contact loading remains independent. A later successful scheduling command replaces the appointment file.

**Pending integration:** the default app parser reports scheduling as unavailable until the real owner/pet lookup is
provided. Once that feature is ready, startup can construct
`new LogicManager(model, storage, new AddressBookParser(participantLookup))`.
The full parse, execute, save, and restart flow is tested with a test-only lookup; production has no permissive stub.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, it continues to the end of the diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo execute:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

    - 1a2. Groomer enters a corrected date.
    - Steps 1a1-1a2 are repeated until the date is valid.
    - Use case resumes from step 2.
- 2a. There are no appointments on that date.
    - 2a1. BuBu informs Groomer that nothing is scheduled.
    - Use case ends.
- 3a. No client matches the search.
    - 3b1. BuBu informs Groomer that no clients match.
    - 3b2. Groomer enters a different search keyword.
    - Steps 3b1-3b2 are repeated until the intended client is found.
    - Use case resumes from step 4.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `25` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1,000 total records (clients, pets, and appointments combined) and display schedules without noticeable sluggishness in performance.
3.  A user with above-average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Should respond to any user command and refresh the interface display within 1 second during typical usage.
5.  Should not consume excessive memory, maintaining an active runtime memory footprint below 500 MB under normal operation.
6.  Should persist all data immediately to the local storage file upon the completion of each mutating command so that data is preserved in the event of an abrupt application exit or crash.
7.  Should be distributed as a single standalone executable JAR file and run without requiring an external installer, setup wizard, or administrative privileges.
8.  Should store all application data locally in a human-editable plain-text file without requiring an external database management system.
9.  Should operate completely offline without requiring an active internet connection, cloud services, or external server components.
10. Should be designed for a single user per instance, relying on the host operating system's user account security without managing separate in-app user accounts or access levels.
11. Should maintain atomic state updates such that any command that encounters a parsing or execution error leaves stored data completely unmodified.
12. Should start safely and inform the user if the local data file is missing, empty, or corrupted, rather than terminating unexpectedly.
13. Should remain fully functional and legible on standard laptop screen resolutions (1920x1080, 1440x900, 1366x768) across 13- to 16-inch displays without text truncation or horizontal scrolling.
14. Will not perform any background automated tasks (such as sending scheduled reminder messages or running background daemons) when the application is idle or closed.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, or macOS
* **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: The lightweight, human-readable plain-text format used by BuBu for local persistent file storage.
* **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A text-based user interface where the groomer issues discrete text commands to execute operations.
* **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: The visual layout built with JavaFX that displays formatted client lists, pet profiles and schedule information.
* **Appointment**: A scheduled mobile grooming engagement linking a specific client and pet to a date, time, and care requirements.
* **Care Requirements**: Special notes, medical conditions, temperamental traits, behavioral warnings, or styling preferences associated with a pet.
* **Behavioral Quirks**: Custom tags attached to a pet profile indicating temperamental traits or handling considerations (e.g., `cage-anxious`, `nipper`, `hyperactive`) to help the groomer prepare appropriate equipment.
* **Client**: A pet owner profile containing  contact information, including name, phone number, email and home address.
* **Confirmation**: An explicit verification step required by BuBu before completing destructive actions (such as deletions) to avoid accidental data loss.
* **Groomer**: The primary user and actor of BuBu; an independent mobile pet groomer managing appointments, client contacts, and pet profiles on-the-go.
* **Pet Profile**: A distinct record belonging to a specific client that tracks the pet's name, species, optional breed, and care requirements.
* **Rescheduling**: The composite workflow of deleting an existing appointment followed by booking a new slot for the same pet.
* **Service**: A supported grooming option (e.g., full groom, basic bath, nail trim) assigned to an appointment.
* **Time Slot**: A continuous duration on a given date during which a grooming appointment takes place, constrained to 30-minute intervals within working hours.
* **Working Hours**: The allowable operating time frame within which appointments can be booked, defined in BuBu as 08:00 to 20:00.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the JAR file and copy it into an empty folder.

   1. Double-click the JAR file.<br>
      Expected: The GUI opens with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimal.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimal size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Relaunch the app by double-clicking the JAR file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location are retained.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command, with multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: The first contact is deleted from the list. The status message shows the deleted contact's details.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. The status message shows error details.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.
